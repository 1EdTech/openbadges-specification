## About Open Badges
[Open Badges](http://openbadges.org) are visual symbols of accomplishments packed with verifiable metadata according to the Open Badges Specification. The Open Badges Specification defines the properties necessary to define an achievement and award it to a recipient, as well as procedures for verifying badge authenticity and “baking” badge information into portable image files.

The Open Badges Specification was developed by the [Mozilla Foundation](http://mozillafoundation.org) with support from the [MacArthur Foundation](https://www.macfound.org/). The specification is managed by the [Badge Alliance](http://badgealliance.org)
