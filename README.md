# Open Badges Specifications

A repository for the main Open Badges specifications.

* [Assertion](/Assertion/latest.md): Main specification for the badge data. If you want to understand how badges are made and verified, this is the place to look.

* [Baking](/Badge-Baking/latest.md): Badge “baking” is the process of embedding a badge assertion into an image (a PNG or an SVG) so that where ever that image goes, the assertion data goes with it and the badge can be independently verified.
