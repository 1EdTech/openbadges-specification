# openbadges-specification
## Specification documents related to Open Badges
The published version of Open Badges 2.0 is in main and develop. Version 2.1 is only in develop until Final.

## Proposals
For information about how to propose a new feature or material change to the specification, please see `proposals/README.md`.

## Branches
* __main__: stable, deployable branch that stores the official release history including releases designated as Candidate Final Public.
* __develop__: unstable development branch. Current work that targets a future release is merged into this branch.
* __feature/new-feature-name__: unstable feature branch. Work that may be approved for future release will be developed in here and branched from __develop__.

## Contibuting

Please follow these steps to contribute a change to the openbadges-specification repository:

1. Open an issue on the repository if you have not done so already to allow for dialog beyond a pull request.
1. Create a new branch from __develop__ with a designation that provides a brief high-level description i.e. __documentation/branching-strategy__.
1. Make your changes in your new branch. You can choose to do these in a fork of the repository if you wish. Please include the issue number where appropriate when making commits.
1. Push those changes to the core repository or your fork.
1. Open a pull request with the target branch of __develop__ and the source of your branch. Please include the issue number when authoring a pull request.
1. Make your changes aware to the workgroup by raising them during a workgroup meeting. This will typically involve putting the topic on the agenda by way of the workgroup chair and/or an IMS Global staff member.
1. Pull request or general merges into the __develop__ branch generally require workgroup approval unless IMS Staff or the workgroup chair indicate otherwise.
