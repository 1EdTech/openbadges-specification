# Open Badges Specification
This repository is the official location for the Open Badges Specification. See [the published documentation](https://openbadgespec.org) (v1.1) for information about the current Open Badges standard. The documentation is generated from the contents of this repository. Contribute pull requests here to suggest edits, and join the [Badge Alliance Standard Working Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ba-standard) to participate in the continuing development of the spec.

## Historical versions: 
* [Assertion](/Assertion/latest.md): v1.0

* [Baking](/Badge-Baking/latest.md): Badge “baking” is the process of embedding a badge assertion into an image (a PNG or an SVG) so that where ever that image goes, the assertion data goes with it and the badge can be independently verified.

* [Backpack](/backpack.md) [**TODO**]: A badge “backpack” is a web site/application that can take in & export badges. The Open Badges JavaScript API expects endpoints to be in specific or discoverable locations, and this document details that.
