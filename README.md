## Participant Instructions
By accessing these resources, you hereby acknowledge that the IMS Member or
Invited Participant organization has elected to participate in the IMS/GLC
Project Group / Task Force associated with this repository and that he or she is
serving as the representative of the organization with respect to the IMS IPR Policy.

The IMS/GLC Member or Invited Participant organization and the individual
agreeing to this acknowledgement understand the requirement to sign and complete
the IMS Intellectual Property Rights Election form (Appendix B of the IPR Policy)
at the earlier of the Internal Draft stage and/or 6 months after the group has
been chartered, and will abide by all rules of the IPR Policy which is posted at
the following web page: http://www.imsglobal.org/IPR/imsipr_policyFinal.pdf

In the event that the individual's personal participation in the Project Group
ceases prior to completion and signing of the Intellectual Property Rights
Election form, the Member or Invited Participant organization will designate a
replacement representative who shall be required to acknowledge participation.
In the event that a replacement representative is not appointed provision 3.5.ii
of the Policy will be applicable.

Documents and materials posted in the forum are made available for the purposes
of the IMS Project Group / Task Force to which this repository pertains only and
should not be distributed outside of the project group without the express written
consent of IMS GLC.  Provision of any work documents outside of the project
group/task force will revoke all privileges as an Invited Guest. Any documents
provided to non-participants will be done by IMS GLC only on the IMS GLC public
website when the documents become publicly available.

All resources of the Project Groups including web pages, documents, and any other
records of discussions used for sharing project materials/work/communications,
must be located only on facilities designated by IMS GLC. Project Groups may not
conduct official business or technical discussions, store documents(except for
personal use), or host web pages on servers or systems not designated by IMS GLC.
Project group participants are authorized to download and work on materials as
necessary.

Participants in the Project Groups and Repositories are solely responsible for
the content of their posts. Posting of technical material to the repository, in
appropriate circumstances, be deemed a contribution to that Project Group under
the IMS GLC IPR Policy. IMS GLC members and participants are responsible for their
contributions under the terms described in that policy.
