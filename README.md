# Open Badges Specifications

A repository for the main Open Badges specifications.

* [Assertion](/Assertion/latest.md): Main specification for badge data. Outlines the structure of the component parts in an awarded badge, including the generic badge definition and issuer organization.

* [Baking](/Badge-Baking/latest.md): Badge "baking" is the process of embedding a badge assertion into an image (a PNG or an SVG) so that where ever that image goes, the assertion data goes with it and the badge can be independently verified.
