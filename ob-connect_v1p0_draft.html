        <h3>Design Goals and Rationale</h3>
        <p>The Badge Connect API is a specification that allows badge recipients to easily move their Assertions between platforms to streamline the experience of earning and using Open Badges. The initial scope for this specification will cover Assertions and Profiles, with potential additions in future versions of other types of data held by applications in the various Open Badges ecosystem roles of Issuer, Displayer, and Host.</p>

      <h2>API</h2>
      <p>Badge Connect defines a JSON API protocol to be implemented by applications serving in the
        roles of Host and Relying Party. Typically Relying Parties SHOULD be certified Open Badges
        services in the Open Badges roles of Displayer or Issuer, though Hosts may also be relying
        parties to serve the <a href="#usecases-host-host-transfer">Host to Host transfer use case
        </a>. Badge Connect API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, granular resource-based permission
        scopes, and offers a number of required endpoints that MUST be implemented by Hosts and
        Relying Parties or both.
      </p>

      <section id="api-authentication">
        <h3>Authentication</h3>
        <p>A Relying Party requests a token scoped for access to Open Badges Assertions on a Host
          that belong to a user (resource owner) of that Host service, using an OAuth 2.0
          Authorization Code Grant as described in the <a href="#TODO">IMS Security Framework</a>.
          Once a Relying Party obtains a code, it exchanges the code for a token by signing a
          request using a public key declared in its manifest file. Subsequent API requests are
          authenticated with the token until its expiration, after which it MAY be renewed if the
          Host supports renewal.
        </p>
        <section id="oauth-token">
          <h3>Obtaining Tokens</h3>
          <p>The user starts on the Relying Party service and is offered the chance to connect that
            service to their chosen Host. The user supplies the Relying Party with the Host domain
            authority or selects their Host from a list. The Relying Party then MAY initiate an
            authorization request by redirecting the user to the Host's AuthorizationURI as
            declared in the Host's Open Badge Connect Manifest. This HTTP GET request MUST have a
            <code>redirect_uri</code> query with the absolute URI of the Relying Party's
            redirection endpoint, urlencoded as well as a list of requested scopes from the options
            available, according to the OAuth 2.0 Specification. The required <code>client_id</code>
            parameter MUST be the string <code>BADGE_CONNECT</code>.
          </p>

          <p>If the Host does not recognize the Relying Party's redirection endpoint from a prior
            connection with this Relying Party, the Host SHOULD request the Badge Connect
            Manifest from the Relying Party from the well-known manifest path relative to the
            authority of the provided <code>redirect_uri</code> parameter. If the manifest file is
            valid under the requirements of this specification and the specified redirection
            endpoint appears in the manifest, the Host MAY honor the request to present the
            user/resource owner with the option to authorize the request. If the Host recognizes
            the Relying Party, the Host MAY skip the manifest check for subsequent authorization
            requests. If the user authorizes the Relying Party to access their resources with the
            requested scopes, the Host MUST redirect the user back to the redirect_uri with a
            <code>code</code> query parameter. The Relying Party may use this code in the next step
            to obtain a token.
          </p>

          <p>With a code in hand, the Relying Party SHOULD attempt to exchange the code for a
            token. The Relying Party makes a authorization grant POST request to the Host's
            tokenUri, as declared in the Host's Badge Connect Manifest. This request is
            authenticated using the "Using JSON Web Tokens with OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Grant"
            method described in the IMS Security Framework. The Relying Party generates a JWT
            [[!RFC7519]] bearer token as a means for authentication in requesting an OAuth 2.0
            access token. If the Host finds the request to be valid, it generates and returns an
            access token in the form specified by the IMS Security Framework. If the request is
            invalid, the Host MUST return an error message with an HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status
            code and a body matching the Badge Connect response <a href="#envelope">envelope</a>.
          </p>
        </section>
        <section id="oauth-token">
          <h3>Authenticating with Tokens</h3>
          <p>After obtaining a token using the above method, a Relying Party MAY request resources
            controlled by the resource owner from Host endpoints using the token in the HTTP
            Authorization header. An example follows, where <code>2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA</code> is
            the token:</p>
          <pre>Authorization: Bearer 2YotnFZFEjr1zCsicMWpAA</pre>
        </section>
        <section id="oauth-token">
            <h3>Revocation by Resource Owner</h3>
            <p>Host platforms MUST provide a list of authorized clients to the resource owner for review. The list SHOULD identify the relying party and when the grant was created. From this list the resource owner MUST be able to revoke the relying party's access.</p>
            <p>Subsequent attempts to use the relevant revoked access or refresh tokens SHOULD result in a 401 UNAUTHENTICATED error.</p>
        </section>
      </section>

      <section id="api-scopes">
        <h3>Scopes</h3>
        <p>Access to resources in the Badge Connect API require an access token. These access
          tokens have a permissioned scope when they are created and inform the responding
          application which resources the entity has access to.

        <h3>Retry Behavior</h3>
        <p>Receivers of requests MAY implement a <strong>Retry-After</strong> header to indicate a period of time to wait before attempting the request again.</p>
        <p>If no <strong>Retry-After</strong> header is present and the response is non-2XX, it is recommended to retry the request in 30 minutes for an additional two attempts. After which, it MAY be desirable to alert the recipient that there is an issue with the connection (e.g. perhaps they need to reauthenticate or manually trigger the request when they believe services are back up).</p>
