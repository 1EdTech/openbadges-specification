        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        An extension to Open Badges that allows issuers to add additional titled 
        sections of descriptive content to their badges and profiles.
      </section>

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>This extension provides extra descriptive metadata about a 
            BadgeClass or Issuer Profile. Usage is primarily intended to serve 
            human-readable display contexts. One or more implementations of this 
            extension may appear within a BadgeClass, for instance, offering 
            additional space to explain information that should travel with the 
            badge in the rich text Markdown format.</p>

          <h3>Use cases</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Present to would-be earners a list of links to educational 
              resources that may aid in learning the content or skills necessary 
              to meet the badge's criteria.</li>
            <li>Add a section describing job categories related to a badge.</li>
            <li>Include information about research done on the badge's design or 
              assessment methodology that could signal enhanced market value.</li>
            <li>Describe an Issuer Profile more fully, in terms of its focus or 
              links to previous projects.</li>

        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <p>The extension offers a paired name and narrative field so that 
          implementers can describe one or more sections of extra description, 
          where each section has both a name to identify its purpose as well as 
          a markdown-formatted text narrative. The name and narrative fields 
          already defined in the Open Badges V2 context are reused in this new 
          structure.</p>
