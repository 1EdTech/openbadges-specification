  <h2 id="vc-extensions">Verifiable Credentials Extensions</h2>

  <p>
    The [[[VC-DATA-MODEL]]] standard defines several types of extensions to enable "permissionless innovation". Some of
    the extensions are tracked in the [[[VC-EXTENSION-REGISTRY]]]. VC extensions fall into 6 categories:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Proof Methods</li>
    <li>Status Methods</li>
    <li>Data Schema Validation Methods</li>
    <li>Refresh Methods</li>
    <li>Terms of Use Methods</li>
    <li>Evidence Methods</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    This standard defines three VC extensions: a Status Method <a href="#status-extension">RevocationList</a>, a
    Refresh Method <a href="#refresh-extension">CredentialRefresh</a>, and a Data Schema Validation Method called
    <a href="#schema-extension">JsonSchemaValidator2019</a>. Future versions of this specification may define
    additional extensions.
  </p>
  <div class="note">
    These extensions are designed to work with any [=verifiable credential=] and may be contributed to the
    [[VC-EXTENSION-REGISTRY]] in the future.
  </div>

  <section>
    <h3 id="status-extension">RevocationList</h3>
    <p>
      The "RevocationList" Status Method is used by a [=verifier=] to determine if the [=verifiable credential=] has
      been revoked. Or if a previously revoked credential has been reinstated. This extension provides one of the
      benefits of Hosted Verification in [[OB-20]].
    </p>

    <h4>Determine if a Credential is Revoked</h4>
    <p>
      If the <code>credentialStatus</code> property is present, and the <code>type</code> of the
      <a href="#credentialstatus">CredentialStatus</a> object is "RevocationList", the [=verifier=] SHOULD
      follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fetch the <a href="#revocationlist">RevocationList</a> from the <code>id</code> of the
        <a href="#credentialstatus">CredentialStatus</a> object.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the <code>id</code> of the credential being verified appears in the list of <code>revokedCredentials</code>
        and the corresponding <code>revoked</code> property is <code>true</code> or ommitted, then the credential has
        been revoked by the issuer.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="refresh-extension">CredentialRefresh</h3>

    <p>
      The "CredentialRefresh" Refresh Method is used by a [=verifier=] to retrieve the current version of a [=verifiable
      credential=]. This extension provides one of the benefits of Hosted Verification in [[OB-20]].
    </p>

    <h4>Refresh a Credential</h4>
    <p>
      If the <code>credentialRefresh</code> property is present, and the <code>type</code> of the
      <a href="#credentialrefresh">CredentialRefresh</a> object is "CredentialRefresh", the [=verifier=] SHOULD
      follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fetch the [=verifiable credential=] from the <code>id</code> of the
        <a href="#credentialrefresh">CredentialRefresh</a> object.
      </li>
      <li>
        Update the credential in hand with the fetched credential.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h3 id="schema-extension">JsonSchemaValidator2019</h3>

    <p>
      The "JsonSchemaValidator2019" Data Schema Validation Method points to a [[JSON-SCHEMA-2019-09]] file that can be
      used by a [=verifier=] to determine if the [=verifiable credential=] is well formed. This extension is used to
      complete the "data validation" step described in [[[#verification]]].
    </p>

    <h4>Validate a Credential's JSON Schema</h4>
    <p>
      If the <code>credentialSchema</code> property is present, and the <code>type</code> of the
      <a href="#credentialschema">CredentialSchema</a> object is "JsonSchemaValidator2019", the [=verifier=] SHOULD
      follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Fetch the [[JSON-SCHEMA-2019-09]] file from the <code>id</code> of the <a
          href="#credentialschema">CredentialSchema</a> object.
      </li>
      <li>
        <a href="#serialization">Serialize</a> the credential into a JSON string.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a JSON Schema Validator compatible with [[JSON-SCHEMA-VALIDATION-2019-09]] (home grown or off-the-shelf)
        to validate the credential's serialized JSON string.
      </li>
    </ol>
