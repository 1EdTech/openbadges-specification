  <p>
    The [[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] standard defines several types of extensions to enable "permissionless innovation".
    Conformant extensions are tracked in the [[[VC-EXTENSION-REGISTRY]]].
  </p>
  <p>
    This standard references four VC Extensions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>A Proof Method called <code>DataIntegrityProof</code> defined at [[[VC-DI-EDDSA]]]</li>
    <li>A Status Method called [[[VCRL-10]]]</li>
    <li>A Refresh Method called [[[VCCR-10]]]</li>
    <li>A Data Schema Validation Method called [[[VCCS-10]]]</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="note">
    The 1EdTech extensions are designed to work with any [=verifiable credential=] and may be contributed to the
    [[VC-EXTENSION-REGISTRY]] in the future.
