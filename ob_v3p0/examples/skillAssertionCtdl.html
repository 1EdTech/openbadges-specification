<div class="note">
  A Skill Assertion credential is just like a <a href=""#basic-openbadgecredential">basic OpenBadgeCredential</a> in how an Achievement is included, except that it makes a claim referencing an Achievement that is generic to allow for use by many possible issuers. The Achievement here is aligned to a Competency registered on the Credential Registry and described in CTDL.
