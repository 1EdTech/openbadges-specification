<h2>Understanding the API</h2>

<p>This specification defines a JSON API ([[OB-REST-30]]) protocol to be implemented by applications serving in the
  roles of Provider and Consumer. The API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, granular resource-based permission
  scopes, and offers a number of required endpoints that MUST be implemented by Providers and
  Consumers or both.

  <h3>Architecture</h3>
  <figure id="ad-architecture">
    <img src="images/OBC_Architecture.svg" />
    <figcaption>Architecture</figcaption>
  </figure>
  <p>There are five key components to the API architecture.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>Resource Owner</dt>
    <dd>This is the user that owns the resources (badges) that are on the Provider.</dd>
    <dt>Web Browser</dt>
    <dd>This is the web browser application that the user interacts with.</dd>
    <dt>Consumer</dt>
    <dd>
      This is the web application that interacts with the Provider on behalf of
      the resource owner. This component is called the Consumer in the
      IMS Security Framework [[SEC-10]].
    </dd>
    <dt>Authorization Server</dt>
    <dd>
      This is a server that implements the OAuth 2.0 endpoints on behalf of
      the Provider. In many systems, the Authorization Server and the Provider are
      combined.
    </dd>
    <dt>Provider</dt>
    <dd>
      This is the resource server that has the protected resources (badges).
      This component is called the Provider in the IMS Security Framework [[SEC-10]].
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    The role of each component during <a href="#oauth-registration">Registration</a>,
    <a href="#oauth-token">Obtaining Tokens</a>, and <a href="#oauth-auth">Authenticating with Tokens</a>
    are described below.

<section id="api-authentication">
  <h3>Authentication</h3>
  <p>A Consumer requests a token scoped for access to Open Badges Assertions on a Provider
    that belong to a user (resource owner) of that Provider service, using an OAuth 2.0
    Authorization Code Grant as described in Section 4.2 of the IMS Security Framework [[SEC-10]].
    Once a Consumer obtains a code, it exchanges the code for an access token and optionally
    a refresh token. Subsequent API requests are authenticated with the access token until its
    expiration. If the Provider previously provided a refresh token, the access token can be renewed.
