## Abstract

This specification is a new version of the [IMS Global Open Badges Specification](https://www.imsglobal.org/activity/digital-badges) that aligns with the conventions of the [[[VC-DATA-MODEL]]] for the use cases of [=Defined Achievement Claim=] and a [=Skill Claim=]. The credentials that are produced are easily be bundled into [=Comprehensive Learner Records=] and [=Verifiable Presentations=]. Portability and learner data privacy are improved by expanding the usage of cryptographic proofs/signatures, because this format will be compatible with a growing array of proof schemas that are developed for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model.
