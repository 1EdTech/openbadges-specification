## Linked Data Proof Test Vector

This chapter is an example of the signing process of a given credential with an Linked Data Proof producing a `DataIntegrityProof` of a public key expressed in `eddsa-2022` format.

### Key pair & Multikey

For this example we are using the following keypair:
* Public key (hex): `4bdeafde2ea8beefadd8c699b5c7e0704cf51154d52e17b20b71337ca04cc5a5`
* Private key (hex): `6241a409e6707bb640a0140a8a32bc3d193c33a661747284d6adfa4ed4180be44bdeafde2ea8beefadd8c699b5c7e0704cf51154d52e17b20b71337ca04cc5a5`

The `MultiKey` used in this example is as follows:
```json
 {
  id: 'https://example.com/issuers/876543#z6MkjZRZv3aez3r18pB1RBFJR1kwUVJ5jHt92JmQwXbd5hwi',
  controller: 'https://example.com/issuers/876543',
  publicKey: Uint8Array(32) [
     75, 222, 175, 222,  46, 168, 190,
    239, 173, 216, 198, 153, 181, 199,
    224, 112,  76, 245,  17,  84, 213,
     46,  23, 178,  11, 113,  51, 124,
    160,  76, 197, 165
  ],
  secretKey: Uint8Array(64) [
     98,  65, 164,   9, 230, 112, 123, 182,  64, 160,  20,
     10, 138,  50, 188,  61,  25,  60,  51, 166,  97, 116,
    114, 132, 214, 173, 250,  78, 212,  24,  11, 228,  75,
    222, 175, 222,  46, 168, 190, 239, 173, 216, 198, 153,
    181, 199, 224, 112,  76, 245,  17,  84, 213,  46,  23,
    178,  11, 113,  51, 124, 160,  76, 197, 165
  ],
  publicKeyMultibase: 'z6MkjZRZv3aez3r18pB1RBFJR1kwUVJ5jHt92JmQwXbd5hwi',
  secretKeyMultibase: 'zrv2bqTbNwCTsRrHFcJCPjVAduh4Ezcnoq1A3ZxH1GWTNkxipLVuaAoMFmze2gFN9oNXfJjufxSHWVZzsJiUsMHFMcx',
  revoked: undefined,

}
```
