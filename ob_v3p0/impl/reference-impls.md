## Using Reference Implementations

The Reference Implementation is an 1EdTech implementation of Open Badges 3.0 and
Comprehensive Learner Record 2.0 which contains a Issuer, a Displayer and a
Host. The reference implementation is written in .NET. We provide source code
and a hosted version of the tool. Our reference implementation has passed
Conformance Certification and is complete with 100% automated tests. Developers
can run it locally and develop against this tool. We are working to have this
available in multiple languages and common functionality eventually available as
libraries. From OB 3.0 and CLR 2.0 on, we will be keeping this implementation
up-to-date, to have all versions supported.

-   Source Code is a member-only resource.
-   Hosted version will be available to the public, with services being a
    member-only resource.
