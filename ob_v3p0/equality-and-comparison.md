## Credential's equality and comparison algorithm

Credential equality and comparison is the process to determine whether a [=verifiable credential=]  is the same to another one.

Host SHOULD treat a credential as the same than another when the [issuer](#profile)'s \`id\` and the [AchievementCredential](#achievementcredential)'s \`id\` are the same. The one with the newer \`issuanceDate\` is the more up-to-date representation and could be interpreted as a replacement of the prior issued credential.
