## Abstract

Open Badges are visual symbols of accomplishments packed with verifiable metadata according to the Open Badges specification. The Open Badges 3.0 specification [OB-30] defines the properties necessary to define an achievement and award it to a recipient, as well as procedures for verifying badge authenticity and “baking” badge information into portable image files. It includes term definitions for representations of data in Open Badges and defines an API for exchanging badge information. These term definitions appear in the current Open Badges JSON-LD Context File.

This version of the specification aligns Open Badges with the conventions of the [[[VC-DATA-MODEL-2.0]]] for the use cases of [=Defined Achievement Claim=] and a [=Skill Claim=]. The credentials that are produced are easily be bundled into [=Comprehensive Learner Records=] and [=Verifiable Presentations=]. Portability and learner data privacy are improved by expanding the usage of cryptographic proofs/signatures, because this format will be compatible with a growing array of proof schemas that are developed for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model.
