## Open Badges 3.0 Issuer Service Conformance {#issuer-conformance}

A Open Badges **Issuer** is an application that allows for the creation of OpenBadgeCredentials and the subsequent delivery of OpenBadgeCredentials to recipients that conform to the Open Badges Specification. The candidate platform must issue a valid baked badge and demonstrate how the badge is retrieved by the recipient. The candidate platform must also meet Service Consumer (Write) requirements and can send an AchievementCredential or a Profile to a product that conforms to Service Provider (Write) requirements.

### Tests {#issuer-tests}

1. Create a valid baked 3.0 badge and issue it to the recipient \`conformance@imsglobal.org\` and submit the issued badge to the conformance test system.
1. Complete tests of, at least, required endpoints of [[[#service-consumer-write]]].
