## Data Integrity

This section describes mechanisms for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of [AssertionCredential](#org.1edtech.ob.v3p0.assertioncredential.class) documents and payloads. For general information about data integrity, please see [[[DATA-INTEGRITY]]].

### Proofs

A data integrity proof is comprised of information about the proof, parameters required to verify it, and the proof value itself. Please see the [Proof](#proof) class for details.

To ensure interoperability, this specification requires conforming implementations support ...
