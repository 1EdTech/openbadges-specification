        This document describes a number of classes and properties that can be used to express authenticable claims by issuers about recipients in the form of Linked Data credentials. Each credential makes claims about a recipient’s qualifications or qualities. These claims represent either achievement of a particular defined benchmark as assessed by the issuer, or one or more properties of the recipient. When recorded and transmitted according to this specification, credentials are possible to be validated as authentic expressions of issuer’s trust in credential recipients.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This document describes a number of classes and properties that can be used to express authenticable claims by issuers about recipients in the form of Linked Data credentials. Each credential makes claims about a recipient’s qualifications or qualities. These claims represent either achievement of a particular defined benchmark as assessed by the issuer, or one or more properties of the recipient. When recorded and transmitted according to this specification, credentials are possible to be validated as authentic expressions of issuer’s trust in credential recipients. 
      </p>

      <p>
        The terms defined here serve use cases identified by the Credentials Community Group.

      <h2>Glossary</h2>

      <section>
        <h3>Credential</h3>
        <p>
          A claim from an entity(s) that denotes qualification, achievement, quality, or other piece of information about an entity’s background such as a name, government ID, payment provider, home address, or university degree. 
        </p>
      </section> 

      <section>
        <h3 id="#Issuer">Issuer</h3>
        <p>
          An entity that creates and assigns credentials to recipients. It may be expressed as an <a href="#Identity">Identity</a> document.
        </p>

        <p class="issue">
          This and potentially a couple other terms may need to be moved down or duplicated as a class, since we're referencing it as a class that may be included in credentials.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Recipient</h3>
        <p>
          Also known as the credentialee, an entity that is in control of a particular credential; who is typically both the primary subject of the information in a credential and the entity that initiates its transmission to a consumer. It may be expressed as an <a href="#Identity">Identity</a> document.
        </p>
      </section> 

      <section>
        <h3>Consumer</h3>
        <p>
          An entity that is the end user of a credential. Consumers read, validate, and take action based on credentials.
        </p>
      
        <!-- Requestor and Audience: two types of Consumer -->
        <section>
          <h3>Requestor</h3>
          <p>
            An entity that requests a credential from a recipient.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          <h3>Audience</h3>
          <p>
            A consumer entity who is presented a credential, presumably by its recipient.
          </p>
        </section>

      </section> 

      <section>
        <h3>User Agent</h3>
        <p>
          A program, such as a browser or other Web client, that mediates the communication between parties on behalf of an issuer, recipient or consumer, such as the process of negotiating the response to a requestor’s request for a particular type of credential on behalf or a recipient.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Credential Management Service</h3>
        <p>
          A program, such as a credential storage vault, backpack, or personal credential wallet, that stores and protects access to an credentialee's credentials and can, on request, provide secure access to Requestors.  The software process involved is known as the Credential Agent. 
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Credential Agent</h3>
        <p>
          A program that mediates secure access of a credentialee’s credentials for a requestor on behalf of the credential management service.

            An Identity is a document representing an entity (that could serve as Issuer, Recipient, or Consumer of credentials). It is defined in terms of descriptive properties and recognized achievements. Together, these describe the entity and list the verifiable credentials that assert those properties and achievements.

          The claims made by a Credential are packaged as a Claim Set, a set of properties asserted about the recipient. Each claim is a property-value pair, where the issuer asserts one quality or attribute of a credential recipient or of an achievement attributable to the earner. Each property name takes the form of an IRI, dereferencable within the document context to a term definition.

          The following example, which would appear as a component of a Credential is a set of claims defining the birthdate and governmentId number that apply to a particular recipient identity. The IRI of the recipient identity is the id (aliased in the context to JSON-LD keyword "@id") of the claim set property. Each of the claim terms that appear here are mapped to an IRI in the context. Otherwise, they would appear as full IRIs.

          A Defined Achievement (also known as a Badge Class) is a specific claim intended to be made about many recipients. A credential class may be specific to one issuer or shared between multiple issuers. It is defined with a name, description, may link to a page describing detailed criteria, and may be visually represented by an image. An issuer property may point to the entity that defined the achievement.

          <p class="issue">
            Historically in the Open Badges specification, the image property in either Defined Achievement (BadgeClass) or Defined Achievement Assertion could optionally be represented as a dataURI instead of a URL. This was suboptimal for a couple reasons. Should that option be outlawed, or is there a graceful way to denote that something might be an @id or a dataURI? Also, what markup is appropriate for a remote linked resource in the "associated value" field?
