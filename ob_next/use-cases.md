# Open Badges Next Use Cases

This document contains use cases submitted by the members of the Open Badges Workgroup for consideration in the next
version of the Open Badges Specification. Each use case contains a title and information about a specific problem or
opportunity, information about the motivation or importance, and a description of a specification-level capability or
restriction that could serve the use case when implemented in the ecosystem. New use cases may be submitted by pull
request. All information submitted must be compatible with IMS Global intellectual property rights policies for open
implementation of specifications resulting from the contribution.

When the next version of the specification is assigned a version number and drafted as draft documents, selected use
cases from this document will be incorporated, and this document will be deleted.
