# Open Badge Proposals

## Before you start your proposal

Open Badges is a stable and widely adopted specification. Before adding new features the workgroup must go through a process of documenting

- Create a ticket to pitch your idea to the Open Badges working group. The ticket needs to be created in the [openbadges-specification](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/openbadges-specification/issues/new) repository.
- Discuss your idea with the Open Badges working group.
- The working group will make sure that the is right for an Open Badges feature, then if approved, you can start your proposal document.

## Creating a new proposal

- Create a new branch or fork on this repo.
- Create a copy of the `proposals/a-template` folder and rename it with your proposal name (e.g. `proposals/openbadges-my-awesome-proposal`).
- In your new proposal folder, follow the instructions in the README.md file on how to set up and organize your proposal.
- Once you are happy with your proposal, or if you wish to get feedback from the working group, create a pull request against the `develop` branch, then link it in your ticket so that the working group knows you wish for them to review it.
- Discuss your proposal in the working group and on the pull request.
- At this point your proposal will continue to be iterated upon until it is approved by the working group for wider review.
