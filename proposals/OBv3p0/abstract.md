## Abstract

This is a proposal to align the [IMS Global Open Badges Specification](https://openbadgespec.org) to the conventions of the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) for the use cases of Defined Achievement Claim and a Skill Claim. The credentials that would be produced under this proposal could easily be bundled into Comprehensive Learner Records and Verifiable Presentations. Portability and learner data privacy may be improved by expanding the usage of cryptographic proofs/signatures, because this format will be compatible with a growing array of proof schemas that are developed for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model.
