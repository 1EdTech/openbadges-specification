# Open Badges 3.0

This is a change to align the [IMS Global Open Badges Specification](https://openbadgespec.org) to the conventions of the [W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model](https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model/) for the use cases of Defined Achievement Claim and a Skill Claim.

This consists of several specific proposed changes to Open Badges to:

1. use the W3C Verifiable Credentials data model for assertion format, using a `schema:hasCredential` claim to link the credential subject to the defined achievement that they have earned.
2. introduce conventions for using Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs) for issuer and/or recipient identification.
3. add properties to allow for the issuer of an Assertion/Credential issuer to be a separate entity from the BadgeClass creator, where the creator may define eligibility for issuers.
4. add properties that align with CLR such as [AchievementType](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/clr/v1p0/context/clr_v1p0.html#dtExtensibleAchievementType) and [ResultDescription](https://purl.imsglobal.org/spec/clr/v1p0/context/clr_v1p0.html#dtResultDescription).
5. introduce the complementary use case of a skill assertion.

The credentials that would be produced under this proposal could easily be bundled into Comprehensive Learner Records and Verifiable Presentations. Portability and learner data privacy may be improved by expanding the usage of cryptographic proofs/signatures, because this format will be compatible with a growing array of proof schemas that are developed for the Verifiable Credentials Data Model.

# Extension folder setup process

  - [x] Free space
  - [x] Name the service/message/extension: `Open Badges 3.0 as an implementation of Verifiable Credentials`
  - [x] Create a short name/code name: `OBv3p0`
  - [x] Copy `proposals/a-template` directory to a new directory with the short name `proposals/OBv3p0`
  - [x] In new proposal directory find & replace: `ProperProjectName` with the actual name
  - [x] In new proposal directory find & replace: `ShortProjectName` with the actual short name
  - [x] Add a short description of the proposal at the top of this readme
  - [x] Update this readme with other details as needed
  - [x] Update the table in `proposals/readme.md` with the snippet below this checklist
  - [ ] (process decision needed) - See `GitHub Workflow Decisions below`
  - [ ] Delete this setup section and move onto work steps :)

## Documents

- [Abstract](abstract.md)
- [Introduction](introduction.md)
- [The Open Badges 3.0 Specification](specification.md)

### Current Status

Proposal Draft ready for discussion by the Open Badges and CLR Workgroups.

## Process

### Work steps

  - Update `specification.md` with the proposal
  - Push changes to feature branch `OBv3p0` as appropriate
  - Discuss with Open Badges workgroup
  - Tag issues with `OBv3p0`
  - Do work
  - GOTO 1

### Documentation finalization steps

- [ ] Update `respec-support/contributors.js`
- [ ] Update `respec-support/local-biblio.js`
- [ ] Access respec document via `respec-support/specification-wrapper.html` (needs web server to work properly)
- [ ] Clean up any respec errors in `specification.md` ([common markdown problems in respec](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/spec-central/blob/master/markdown-notes.md))
- [ ] Make sure the final respec formatting and structure works well for `specification.md`
