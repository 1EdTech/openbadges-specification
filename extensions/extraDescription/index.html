        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        An extension to Open Badges that allows issuers to add additional titled sections of descriptive content to their badges and profiles.
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <section class="informative">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>This extension provides extra descriptive metadata about a BadgeClass or Issuer Profile. Usage is primarily intended to serve human-readable display contexts. One or more implementations of this extension may appear within a BadgeClass, for instance, offering additional space to explain information that should travel with the badge in the rich text Markdown format.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="informative" id="usecases">                  
          <h3>Use cases</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Present to would-be earners a list of links to educational resources that may aid in learning the content or skills necessary to meet the badge's criteria.</li>
            <li>Add a section describing job categories related to a badge.</li>
            <li>Include information about research done on the badge's design or assessment methodology that could signal enhanced market value.</li>
            <li>Describe an Issuer Profile more fully, in terms of its focus or links to previous projects.</li>          
          </ul>

          <h3>Extendable Badge Objects</h3>

        <h2>Properties</h2>
        <p>The extension offers a paired name and narrative field so that implementers can describe one or more sections of extra description, where each section has both a name to identify its purpose as well as a markdown-formatted text narrative. The name and narrative fields already defined in the Open Badges V2 context are reused in this new structure.</p>
