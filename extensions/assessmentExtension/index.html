        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        An extension to Open Badges that allows issuers to define assessment(s) related to the award process.
      </section>
      
      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <section class="informative">
          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>This extension provides information about single or multiple assessments that would be completed by the recipient as part of
            the requirements for earning an OpenBadge. There could be multiple assessments of different types for each badge earned. Separate,
            independent evaluations of a single assessment could result in multiple assessment/evaluation records, all included in a single
            instance of the extension. Please note that this extension is in draft mode and may not be ready for production.</p>

          <h3>Use cases</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Describe an assessment so a potential recipient understands the process.</li>
            <li>Describe assessment(s) so badge consumers better know what recipients did to earn the badge.</li>
            <li>Include explicit application information to build an automated application form for the badge.</li>
            <li>Describe rubrics related to assessment so recipients, assessors, and consumers have a consistent understanding of the criteria for passing the described assessment(s).</li>
