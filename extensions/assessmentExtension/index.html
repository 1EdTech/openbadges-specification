          <p>This extension provides information about single or multiple
            assessments that would be completed by the recipient as part of the
            requirements for earning an OpenBadge. There could be multiple
            assessments of different types for each badge earned. Separate,
            independent evaluations of a single assessment could result in
            multiple assessment/evaluation records, all included in a single
            instance of the extension. Please note that this extension is in
            draft mode and may not be ready for production.</p>
