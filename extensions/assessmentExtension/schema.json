----- December 1st -----

Heya - I'm back from an epic Thanksgiving road trip followed by a killer sinus infection. Reading emails and was reading Dan's blog posts. Thinking about endorsements. How do you see 2.0 endorsements working? Will they still be a badge for a badge?

[3:14]
Also - hope you had a restful holiday

[3:14]
Should have started there :slightly_smiling_face:

nate [4:18 PM]
I had a nice holiday, but seems a long time ago now.

[4:20]
Endorsement can target more than just a badge, it can target any entity using the recipient property, and can make claims about that entity using the verifiable claims data model. Essentially, an assertion without a BadgeClass, with the option of making additional metadata claims. An important use case will be endorsements of issuer profiles essentially saying "yes this is the University of Oregon Math Department as it claims".

kerri [5:51 PM]
I hear you re: holiday. ok - I figured it would be more than just than just badge. Was thinking more in terms of implementation. How will the endorsement assertion be delivered? Who will host it?


----- December 2nd -----
nate [6:29 PM]
Endorsements should function for verification like other assertions. If hosted verification should be used, endorsement assertions should be hosted on the same platform as the issuer profile.

[6:29]
Endorsements can be shared along with a badge using JSON-LD documents that share a graph of information.


----- December 5th -----
kerri [10:06 AM]
I see. ok. Seems as though the endorsement would be less credible if the issuer is hosting it, wouldn't it? Think I get the last sentence but seeing it in action will help.

Hey Nate - I didn't think I needed to map all the elements in the context if I am mapping the assessment object.

nate [11:59 AM]
It is necessary.

kerri [11:59 AM]
Odd - at one point I thought you said it wouldn't be - I think when we were talking about the accreditation extension.

[12:00]
I'm going to redo some of this and resubmit. I probably won't get it right. These extensions are more complicated than the others.

nate [12:00 PM]
I recall reporting the same issue about the other extension, though don't remember where I made the comment.

kerri [12:00 PM]
Also, re: boolean - wasn't sure how boolean was being treated. We don't have any examples of that yet. Thought perhaps boolean could be a type of string so attempted that....

nate [12:00 PM]
You can try things out in the JSON-LD playground to verify whether your data is coming through.

kerri [12:01 PM]
I did

[12:01]
But I will again.

[12:01]
So I don't need to define the object, just the properties within it or both?

nate [12:01 PM]
Yep, playground will show you that if you make `"assessment": {"unmappedvalue1": 1, "unmappedvalue2":2}`, you won't get any of the unmapped values through in the expanded version

kerri [12:02 PM]
This project is super annoying me and I really want it off my plate.

[12:02]
Sorry if I'm being short.

nate [12:02 PM]
You need to map every single shorthand property name that appears in your input in the context.

kerri [12:02 PM]
It's also 13 degrees here

nate [12:02 PM]
Yikes!

kerri [12:02 PM]
ok

nate [12:02 PM]
It's been a mess here this week. We always get these 31 degree snowstorms, so it turns into a slush and ice bowl

kerri [12:02 PM]
I've seen that. yuck.

[12:03]
How was Hawaii? Which Island?

nate [12:04 PM]
booleans are acceptable values in RDF and JSON/JSON-LD. Unless you already have installed usage of people who are using strings who can't change, I would encourage extension authors to keep data types as simple as possible. We've even got JSON-schema to be able to enforce the data type. :slightly_smiling_face:

[12:04]
Big Island, Hilo side. It was nice. A little rainy and jungly, very warm, beautiful, relaxing.

kerri [12:04 PM]
Nice

[12:04]
Since CTI is using boolean, figured we should too

[12:05]
I'll take another stab at this and do a pr in a little bit.

nate [12:05 PM]
cool beans!

kerri [12:41 PM]
ok - I'm going to submit my changes. Not sure I'm hitting all your feedback since my changes may negate some of them but not sure. We can take from there. on Jekyll locally I don't see a table error in index. There's a space there. I do get a syntax color error in my editor starting on line 130 in the endorsement extension that seems to go away if I comment out one of the asterisks.

kerri [12:48 PM]
ok - it's submitted. Suspect it will take another round of feedback.

[12:48]
The rest of my day is kind of hosed but will keep an eye out for you. I don't feel any pressure to get this done btw. This whole thing has been a hurry up and wait per Mark. So ok with me if you don't get to it today.

nate [12:48 PM]
Cool. I'm not sure why there wasn't a space there for me, maybe I accedentally deleted it after loading up your branch.

[12:49]
I'll see what I can do. I'm in a long series of calls to catch up from vacation already

kerri [12:49 PM]
I switched to a new computer and think my code got screwed up when I merged. It's all my bad. And I rushed last week.

[12:49]
NO biggie

nate [12:49 PM]
new computer?? :slightly_smiling_face: :slightly_smiling_face:

kerri [12:50 PM]
My last one was dying. Not a fancy new mac. 2015 macbook pro but with a shit-ton of ram.

nate [1:31 PM]
That's what I've got. Gotta have that RAM!


----- Today December 22nd, 2016 -----
kerri [9:55 AM]
Good morning. I've reviewed your feedback and submitting changes. Still not sure I have it 100% but take a look and maybe we chat here and I get it done today so this is off our plates. I never heard back from my last email to Mark & all, so they don't seem to be in a hurry any longer but I would like to tie this up as I'm sure you would too.

[9:56]
Am only going to pr assessment right now. Based on how that goes can tidy up accreditation.

[10:00]
Dammit. I'm having a shitty week. I just merged in directly instead of committing to my repo and doing a pr again. Sorry. It's crazy time here.

[10:01]
You can take me off of the openbadges repo.

nate [1:24 PM]
Hehe, I'll adjust those privileges. No problem. Let's chat about pushing it to live spec site on the call today? Sorry your week is rough!

kerri [1:25 PM]
Sorry - can't make the call. I have a 2pm.

[1:26]
And then a 3:30 but can ping you after that.

kerri [4:22 PM]
Hey - I'm around.

nate [4:39 PM]
Howdy!

[4:40]
I have a flexible afternoon here on out

kerri [4:40 PM]
You want to review what I did? Hop on a hangout and bang it out? I'm hoping I'm close...

nate [4:42 PM]
I'm sure you are. The commit history was a little hard for me to review whether you covered all the bases because it went straight to the openbadges/master branch

[4:43]
Hangout then? I'll go grab a meeting room

kerri [4:43 PM]
cool. yeah. will get you a link here
