    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>An extension to Open Badges that allows issuers to define assessment(s) related to the award process.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This extension provides information about single or multiple assessments that would be completed by the recipient as part of the requirements for earning an OpenBadge. There could be multiple assessments of different types for each badge earned.
        Separate, independent evaluations of a single assessment could result in multiple assessment/evaluation records, all included in a single instance of the extension. Please note that this extension is in draft mode and may not be ready for production.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative" id="usecases">
      <h3>Use cases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe an assessment so a potential recipient understands the process.</li>
        <li>Describe assessment(s) so badge consumers better know what recipients did to earn the badge.</li>
        <li>Include explicit application information to build an automated application form for the badge.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note" title="New in OB v3.0">
        New in Open Badges 3.0 is the ability to include a rubric for an Achievement with multiple criterion in the form of `ResultDescription`.
        The adaptation of this extension to this new version implies the limitation of defining only one rubric and rubric criterion per assessment.
      </div>
