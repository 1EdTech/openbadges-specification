    <h2>Abstract</h2>
    <p>An extension to Open Badges that allows issuers to define assessment(s) related to the award process.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>This extension provides information about single or multiple assessments that would be completed by the recipient as part of the requirements for earning an OpenBadge. There could be multiple assessments of different types for each badge earned.
        Separate, independent evaluations of a single assessment could result in multiple assessment/evaluation records, all included in a single instance of the extension. Please note that this extension is in draft mode and may not be ready for production.</p>
    </section>
    <section class="informative" id="usecases">
      <h3>Use cases</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Describe an assessment so a potential recipient understands the process.</li>
        <li>Describe assessment(s) so badge consumers better know what recipients did to earn the badge.</li>
        <li>Include explicit application information to build an automated application form for the badge.</li>
        <li>Describe rubrics related to assessment so recipients, assessors, and consumers have a consistent understanding of the criteria for passing the described assessment(s).</li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Properties</h2>
    <p>This extension has a more deeply nested data structure than many other available extensions. At the top level is a very simple AssessmentExtension object that contains an overall description and one or more detailed assessment descriptors.</p>
