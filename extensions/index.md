## {{ page.title }}
Extensions are community developed contributions to the Open Badges Specification. Any issuer may define and publish them to include new types of metadata in badges. Any other issuer may use the same extensions to publish similar information in a mutually recognizable way.

### Open Badges Community Extensions [(below)](#CommunityExtensions)
Submit your published extensions to this page with a pull request on [GitHub](https://github.com/openbadges/openbadges-specification/blob/master/extensions/index.md), following the existing format of the page.

<small>Note: Extension authors are not required to host extensions on this page in order for them to be valid. Extension authors may publish descriptions, context and/or schema files required for a new extension on any publicly-accessible location, however that location should provide stable hosting for many years, because extended badges will lose their meaning if these resources become inaccessible.</small>


# Extension Example:

### <a id="ExampleExtension"></a> Example Extension Name
This is a definition of an example extension. If it were a real extension, it would describe the purpose of adding it to a badge object. If you follow the link [#ExampleExtension](#ExampleExtension), you'll get to this paragraph. This is the IRI (Internationalized Resource Identifier) to use for implementations of this extension, included below as the compact IRI `extensions:ExampleExtension`. See the [context](./exampleExtension/context.json) and [schema](./exampleExtension/schema.json) files that form the machine-readable core of this extension.

_Authors: [Doug Belshaw](http://dougbelshaw.com) and [Kerri Lemoie](https://github.com/kayaelle)_

An extension allowing for the addition of the geographic coordinates associated with a badge object. For example, geolocation could represent where a Badge Class is available, where a badge was earned or the location of an issuer. The required description property allows implementers to be more specific about the reason location is included. The extended value takes

The content license extension enables issuers to indicate what permissions are granted to the public to reuse BadgeClass metadata in their own badges in terms of an expressive set of open content licenses that have broad global buy-in.

### <a id="OriginalCreator"></a> Original Creator
_Author: [Antti Koskinen](https://github.com/ajk)_

This extension provides a way to track the origin of a badge when one organisation creates it for another.

For example, presume we have organisations X, Y and Z. A badge is created by X and they grant Y and Z the right to issue it.
IssuerClass of X is stored as the OriginalCreator in the BadgeClass and either Y or Z becomes the issuer.

# xAPI Integration
An exploratory prototype draft xAPI vocabulary has been defined so that Open Badges will soon be referencable from Experience API activity streams. See [xAPI Open Badges documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/xapi/) for details.
