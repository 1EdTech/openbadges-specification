    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Design Goals and Rationale</h3>
      <p>Open Badges 2.1 is a specification that adds the Badge Connect&trade; API to Open Badges that allows badge
        recipients
        to easily move their Assertions between
        platforms to streamline the experience of earning and using Open Badges. The initial scope for this
        specification will cover Assertions and Profiles, with potential additions in future versions of other types of
        data held by applications in the various Open Badges ecosystem roles of Issuer, Displayer, and Host.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative" id="usecases">
      <h3>Use cases</h3>
      <p>The following use cases are supported by this specification:</p>
      <table>
        <tbody>
          <tr id="usecases-issuer-host-import">
            <td>A recipient of an Assertion wants to import historically-issued badges into a chosen Host from an Issuer
              platform.</td>
          </tr>
          <tr id="usecases-issuer-host-award">
            <td>A user wishes to authorize an Issuer to push awarded Assertions to their chosen Host upon issue.</td>

    <h2>API</h2>
    <p>Badge Connect&trade; defines a JSON API protocol to be implemented by applications serving in the
      roles of Host and Relying Party. Typically Relying Parties SHOULD be certified Open Badges
      services in the Open Badges roles of Displayer or Issuer, though Hosts may also be relying
      parties to serve the <a href="#usecases-host-host-transfer">Host to Host transfer use case</a>.
      Badge Connect&trade; API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, granular resource-based permission
      scopes, and offers a number of required endpoints that MUST be implemented by Hosts and
      Relying Parties or both.
    </p>

    <section id="api-architecture">
      <h3>Architecture</h3>
      <figure id="ad-architecture">
        <img src="images/OBC_Architecture.svg" />
        <figcaption>Architecture</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>There are five key components to the Badge Connect&trade; API architecture.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Resource Owner</dt>
        <dd>This is the user that owns the resources (badges) that are on the Host.</dd>
        <dt>Web Browser</dt>
        <dd>This is the web browser application that the user interacts with.</dd>
        <dt>Relying Party</dt>
        <dd>
          This is the web application that interacts with the Host on behalf of
          the resource owner. This component is called the Consumer in the
          IMS Security Framework [[SEC-10]].
        </dd>
        <dt>Authorization Server</dt>
        <dd>
          This is a server that implements the OAuth 2.0 endpoints on behalf of
          the Host. In many systems, the Authorization Server and the Host are
          combined.
        </dd>
        <dt>Host</dt>
        <dd>
          This is the resource server that has the protected resources (badges).
          This component is called the Provider in the IMS Security Framework [[SEC-10]].
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The role of each component during <a href="#oauth-registration">Registration</a>,
        <a href="#oauth-token">Obtaining Tokens</a>, and <a href="#oauth-auth">Authenticating with Tokens</a>
        are described below.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="api-authentication">
      <h3>Authentication</h3>
      <p>A Relying Party requests a token scoped for access to Open Badges Assertions on a Host
        that belong to a user (resource owner) of that Host service, using an OAuth 2.0
        Authorization Code Grant as described in Section 4.2 of the IMS Security Framework [[SEC-10]].
        Once a Relying Party obtains a code, it exchanges the code for an access token and optionally
        a refresh token. Subsequent API requests are authenticated with the access token until its
        expiration. If the Host previously provided a refresh token, the access token can be renewed.
      </p>
      <section id="oauth-registration">
        <h3>Registration</h3>
        <p>
          The user starts on the Relying Party application and is offered the chance to connect that
          application to their chosen Host. The user supplies the Relying Party with the Host domain
          authority or selects their Host from a list.
        </p>
        <p>
          When presented with a new target Host by which the Relying Party is attempting to gain
          an access token from, it MUST register itself with the Host and receive client credentials
          in order to proceed with the OAuth 2.0 token exchange. The Relying Party and Host MUST
          implement [[!RFC7591]].
        </p>
        <p>
          If the Relying Party does not know the Host's registration URL, it MUST request the
          <a href="#api-manifest">Manifest</a> as shown this sequence diagram:
        </p>
        <figure id="sd-registration">
          <img src="images/OBC_DynamicClientRegistrationSequenceDiagram.svg" alt="" />
          <figcaption>Dynamic Client Registration Sequence Diagram</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>The registration request MUST use HTTPS (TLS 1.2 or 1.3). An example registration request may look like:</p>
        <pre class="nohighlight">

      <p>Hosts MUST serve the manifest at the well-known path

        domain compliant with [[RFC5785]]. The manifest MUST be provided over secure TLS 1.2 or 1.3 protocol

      </p>

      <h4>Requesting Manifests</h4>
      <p>Upon requesting a Manifest file from a Host,
        the requester SHOULD respect the <code>Cache-Control</code> and
        <code>Expires</code> headers if present in the response and configure
        local cache to match the directives it declares. If directives include
        one of <code>no-cache, no-store</code>, the requester SHOULD NOT cache
        the data for future interactions. If directives include
        <code>max-age</code> or if an <code>Expires</code> header is present,
        the requester SHOULD cache the manifest file data, if valid, up to the
        expiration indicated, either at the time indicated by the Expires
        header or max-age seconds from request time.
      </p>
      <p>An <code>Etag</code> header MAY be offered with the Manifest file
        response. If so, after a resource's declared expiration, a requester
        MAY include an <code>If-None-Match</code> header containing the value
        of the Etag to check if the resource is still fresh. If so the server
        may return a <code>304 Not Modified</code> response status code, and a
        new <code>Expires</code> or <code>Cache-Control</code> header MAY be
        included, which the requester SHOULD use to update the cache expiration.

      <h3>Retry Behavior</h3>
      <p>Receivers of requests MAY implement a <strong>Retry-After</strong> header to indicate a period of time to wait
        before attempting the request again.</p>
      <p>If no <strong>Retry-After</strong> header is present and the response is non-2XX, it is recommended to retry
        the request in 30 minutes for an additional two attempts. After which, it MAY be desirable to alert the
        recipient that there is an issue with the connection (e.g. perhaps they need to reauthenticate or manually
        trigger the request when they believe services are back up).</p>
