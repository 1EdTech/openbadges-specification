## Abstract
Open Badges are visual symbols of accomplishments packed with verifiable metadata according to the Open Badges specification. The Open Badges specification defines the properties necessary to define an achievement and award it to a recipient, as well as procedures for verifying badge authenticity and “baking” badge information into portable image files. It includes term definitions for representations of data in Open Badges. These term definitions appear in the current [[[OB-JSONLD]]].
